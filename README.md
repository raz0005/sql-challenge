# sql-challenge
For the module 9 Challenge, firstly I inspected the CSV  files individually in Excel then created ERD file that examined the relationship between each CSV's and exported a SQL file that showed the schema. Then I created a composite key by linking two primary keys as I identified that there are identical values in the dept emp csv file provided in the starter code.
Then the csv files from the starter were imported in the correct order to create tables that were necessary to work through the data for the next portion of the assignment
Then the required columns and rows were populated by select and join statements in SQL to answer the questions required in the assignment

completed with tutoring and class instructor help as well as tutorials on Youtube on how to create composite key in SQL
